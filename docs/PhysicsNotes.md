# Physics Notes
- This file will focus on relavant physics and fundamental equations for the production of Gimli, aka first-principles thinking

### Gravity
- A fundamental force that will *always* be acting on Gimli. 
- *Everything* has a gravitational pull (affects spacetime), although most are assumed miniscule to irrelevant in calculations.

#### Earth
- 

#### Practical Application
- Gimli should be able to navigate 3 gravitationally different environments
    - Earth, Space, Mars
