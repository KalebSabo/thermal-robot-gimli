# Physics Notes
- This file will focus on relavant physics and fundamental equations for the production of Gimli, aka first-principles thinking

### Gravity
- The force that attracts all objects with mass towards each other.
- A fundamental force that will *always* be acting on Gimli. 
- *Everything* has a gravitational pull (affects spacetime), although most are assumed miniscule to irrelevant in calculations. 
    - Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
        - The gravitational force between two masses is based on mass and distance to each other. 
        - $F$ = $\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$
#### Earth
- 

#### Practical Application
- Future Gimli implementations should have versions that will navigate 4 gravitationally different environments
    - Earth, Moon, Space, Mars
