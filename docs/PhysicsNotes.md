# Physics Notes
- This file will focus on relavant physics and fundamental equations for the production of Gimli, aka first-principles thinking

### Elements
- 

### Density
- quantifies mass of a substance per unit volume, how compact/concentrated a material is. 
- $p = \frac{m}{V}$
- SI unit = $\frac{kg}{m^3}$
    - i.e. Aluminum is 2.699 grams/cm^3

### Gravity
- The force that attracts all objects with mass towards each other.
- A fundamental force that will *always* be acting on Gimli. 
- *Everything* has a gravitational pull (affects spacetime), although most are assumed miniscule to irrelevant in calculations. 
    - Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
        - The gravitational force between two masses is based on mass and distance to each other. 
        - $F$ = $G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$
            - $F$ = Magnitude of the gravitational force between two objects
            - $G$ = The gravitational constant ~6.674*10^-11
            - $r$ = The distance between the two centers of mass (in meters)
        - The above applies to *specifically point-masses/spherical objects* at their center
        - This law applies *universally* regardless of location in space
#### Earth **9.80665 m/s/s**
- Assuming no air resistance
- Net acceleration imparted to objects due to combined effects of Earth's gravitational pull and the centrifugal force from it's rotation. 
- Earth Gravitational Effects
    - The **centrifugal effect** of earth's rotation makes the equator reduce gravity by ~0.3% 
    - Earth **bulges at the equator** = further from the center = less gravitational pull
    - Geology, **local rock densities** and topography (mountains/underground deposits) cause local gravity anomalies 

#### Deep Space **~0 m/s/s**
- Gravity is miniscule in deep space, distance (m) reduces gravity's effect squared
    - no nearby mass = negligible acceleration

#### Moon **~1.62 m/s/s**
- Mass =
