# Notes for Gimli
- This file will focus writing notes on specifically Gimli and its current iteration.

### Update 
- Current as of Jan. 2026

### What is Gimli?
- Gimli is a bipedal ~1 ft (~30 cm) tall robot

### Goals of Gimli?
- Gimli is an introductory design into robotics

### What stage is Gimli at?
- Gimli is currently in the design/material procurement phase

### Future/fun plans for Gimli?
- Gimli the 3D Printing Companion
    - Designed to assist with general 3D printing where it can restock filament, remove/replace completed prints and alert to failed prints.

- Combine Thermal/Additive Manufacturing studies
    - Gimli will be able to have attachments for operating in different environments. 
        - Earth: Convection/Conduction cooling panels (high atmosphere)
        - Space: Radiative cooling panels (no atmosphere)
        - Mars: Mixture of both Earth/Space designs (low atmosphere)
    - Each iteration of the design should be able to easily disassemble/broken down into parts to then be 3D printed for the next stage in the sequence. Earth -> Space -> Mars etc.
