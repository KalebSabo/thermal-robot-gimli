# **Terms and Concepts**
- The goal of this file is to explain robotic engineering terms and concepts

## Circuit Board

### Pins
- Pulling a pin **"low"**
    - Means connecting to a low voltage level
        - often either 0 Volts (V) or Ground (GND)
    - A reset


## Robotic

### Degrees of Freedom (DoF)
- Number of independent ways a robot (or its limbs) can move
    - Each degree of freedom typically corresponds to one controllable motion axis at a *joint*
    - Examples:
        - Roll
        - Pitch 
        - Yaw

### Roll
- Rotation around the *Longitudinal axis*
    - Longitudinal axis: A line from the back of an object to its front
    - i.e. ailerons in an airplane, L-wingtip up/R-wingtip down
  
### Pitch
- Rotation around the *Lateral axis*
    - Lateral axis: A line that runs side-to-side through an object
    - i.e. elevators in an airplane, Nose up/down

### Yaw
- Rotation around the *Vertical axis*
    - Vertical axis: A line that runs from the top to the bottom of an object
    - i.e. rudder in an airplane, Nose left/right
