# Circuit Board Notes
- This file will focus on the circuit board/electronic communication research of Gimli

## Data
- Values or Information
    - There are differing types
        - Raw Data
            - unprocessed
        - Structured Data
            - JSON files, organized notes like this one
        - Processed Data
            - Data that has gone through a process (like an algorithm) and created an output

## Analog
- type of signal or system that represents data as continuous, varying physical quantities
    - like voltage, current or sound waves

## Digital
- 

## Resistor
- 

## Arduino Uno R3
- Currently TBA for Gimli

## ESP32
- ESP32 System-on-Chip (SoC)
    - Combines multiple components
        - i.e. CPU, memory, peripherals
    - Placed on a single silicone die
!['See ESP32_Components Image for a great breakdown'](../05_Images/ESP32_Components.webp)
    - **IO Pins**
        - 30-38 pins
            - **Be careful!!** some pins are specific
!['See IOpinDiagram.png inside Images folder for a great visual](../05_Images/IOpinDiagram.png)
        - Acronyms
            - ADC = Analog-to-Digital Converter
            - CP2102 = Chip Model from Silicon Labs
            - DAC = Digital-to-Analog Convertor
            - EN = Enable
