# Material Notes
- This file will focus on physical/material characteristics of Eragon



## Crystallography
- Study of crystalline structures and properties
- Natural shapes of crystals reflect the atomic structure

### Thermodynamics of Crystallization
- Annealing occurs by the diffusion of atoms within a solid material

### Annealing
- A heat treatment
- Heating causes atoms to migrate to form a crystal lattice

## 3D Printing
- aka Additive Manufacturing


### Polylactic Acid (PLA)
- A common 3D printing filament
    - Low heat resistance, deforms ~60 C 
        - Can be mitigated by Annealing
- Made by Condensation of Lactic Acid with loss of water
