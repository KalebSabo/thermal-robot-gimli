# General Notes
- This file will be for notes not able to fit into any of the catagories. 

## Design Methodology
- Repeat this process for each major subsystem
    - i.e. single servo, single leg, full chasis, gait cycle etc.
    
### Engineering Method
- component-level validation → digital twin simulation → software integration → physical validation → refinement

### Actual Method
- test each part -> FreeCAD mockup -> code implementation -> Simulate -> iterate or real-life test -> iterate or refine
