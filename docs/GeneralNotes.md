# General Notes
- This file will be for notes not able to fit into any of the catagories. 

### Diffusion
- The net movement of anything generally from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.

### Determinism
- Taking a snapshot and applying/quantifying a value
    - The world is continuous, so only use in measurements
    - Its like taking a slice, its true but only for a *determined* point in time 

### Derivative 
- A deterministic value, quantifies a specific change to a single variable. 

### Gradient
- The generalization of the derivative to multiple variables
    - i.e. Combine/Generalize all the derivatives (like a fluid's movements) to get the gradient
        - IT IS STILL STRUCTURED, it creates a vector that points to the steepest increase

## Design Methodology
- Repeat this process for each major subsystem
    - i.e. single servo, single leg, full chasis, gait cycle etc.

### Engineering Method
- component-level validation → digital twin simulation → software integration → physical validation → refinement

### Actual Method
- test each part -> FreeCAD mockup -> code implementation -> Simulate -> iterate or real-life test -> iterate or refine
