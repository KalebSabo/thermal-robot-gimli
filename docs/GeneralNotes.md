# General Notes
- This file will be for notes not able to fit into any of the catagories. 

### Diffusion
- The net movement of anything generally from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.

### Gradient
- the change in the value of a quantity

## Design Methodology
- Repeat this process for each major subsystem
    - i.e. single servo, single leg, full chasis, gait cycle etc.

### Engineering Method
- component-level validation → digital twin simulation → software integration → physical validation → refinement

### Actual Method
- test each part -> FreeCAD mockup -> code implementation -> Simulate -> iterate or real-life test -> iterate or refine
