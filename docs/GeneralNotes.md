# General Notes
- This file will be for notes not able to fit into any of the catagories. 

## Design Methodology
- component-level validation → digital twin simulation → software integration → physical validation → refinement

- test each part → ANSYS/FreeCAD simulation → code implementation → real-life testing → iterate

    - Repeat this process for each major subsystem
        - i.e. single servo, single leg, full chasis, gait cycle etc.
