# Notes for Eragon
- This file will focus writing notes on specifically Eragon and its current iteration.

### Update 
- Current as of Feb. 2026

### What is Eragon?
- Eragon is a bipedal ~1 ft (~30 cm) tall robot 3D printing companion

### Goals of Eragon?
- Eragon is an introductory design into robotics

### What stage is Eragon at?
- Eragon is currently in the design/material procurement phase

### Future/fun plans for Eragon?
- Eragon the 3D Printing Companion
    - Designed to assist with general 3D printing where it can restock filament, remove/replace completed prints and alert to failed prints.
    - This will have a cascade effect to start automating the Additive Manufacturing process to create bigger and better prints. 

- Combine Thermal/Additive Manufacturing studies
    - Eragon will be able to have attachments for operating in different environments. 
        - Earth: Convection/Conduction cooling panels (high atmosphere)
        - Space: Radiative cooling panels (no atmosphere)
        - Moon: Radiative cooling panels (no/low atmosphere)
        - Mars: Mixture of both Earth/Space designs (low atmosphere)
    - Each iteration of the design should be able to easily disassemble/broken down into parts to then be 3D printed for the next stage in the sequence. Earth -> Space -> Mars etc.
