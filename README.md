# Project Gimli

**A compact, mostly 3D-printed bipedal walking robot (~30 cm tall / 1 ft)** built as a hands-on robotics learning project.

Gimli is a small-scale biped designed to teach servo control, basic gait generation, balance feedback with IMU, and real-world mechanical/electrical integration — all while keeping the build affordable, beginner-friendly, and expandable.
