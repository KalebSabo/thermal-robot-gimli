# Notes for Build
- This file will discuss the stl or 3D printing procurement/creation/modeling process

### FreeCAD
- open-source and free Computer-Aided Design software
- Supports offline work and privacy
- Avoids vendor lock-in
- **Highly Customizable**
- Python/C++
- Greater long term autonomy/risk adverse.
- Free
    - dated UI
    - needs to be imported into another Sim for advanced finite element analysis (FEA)

### Blender 
- free versions, is heavier on the artistic side than simulation. 
- Best for organic or artistic models
    - Look into subdivisioning advantages etc.
- Supports CAD add-ons
    - Perhaps a revist once Eragon is built for an **aesthetic upgrade**



### Fusion360
- Cloud connections
- Easy integration into manufacturing, sim and teaming up. **End-to-End workflow.** 
    - Freemium, no commercial use beyond $1k/year
    - Requires an internet connection (sus)
    - free limits
