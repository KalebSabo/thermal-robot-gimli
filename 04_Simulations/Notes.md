# Notes on Simulations
- This file will discuss modeling/simulation of Gimli

## Engineering Simulation Software

### Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE)
- Simulating real-world scenarios in a virtual environment to aid in engineering development projects

### ANSYS 
- A providor of CAE and multiphysics simulations
    - Offers: 3D Design, Electronics, Fluids, Optics and Structures

### Gimli Sim Goals
- Develop a digital twin
- 3D print from a custom ANSYS design
