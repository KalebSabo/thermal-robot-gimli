# Notes on Simulations
- This file will discuss modeling/simulation of Gimli

## Engineering Simulation Software

### Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE)
- Simulating real-world scenarios in a virtual environment to aid in engineering development projects

### ANSYS 
- A providor of CAE and multiphysics simulations
    - Offers: 3D Design, Electronics, Fluids, Optics and Structures

### FreeCAD
- open-source and free Computer-Aided Design software
    - Not as robust as ANSYS, but gets the job done
