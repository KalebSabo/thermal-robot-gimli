# Notes on the Code for Gimli
- This file will contain the notes for developing the codebase to   Gimli.

## Arduino Uno R3 (Outdated)
- c++/Python hybrid programming
- .ino extension
- 7-12V input - 5V operating

## ESP32
- Supports Wifi/Bluetooth
- 3.3V 

### Python
- Easier but inefficient
- Main programming used in AI 
    - Computer Vision
    - Data Processing
    - UI 

#### Practical Application TBA
- Could implement on a host, where commands are sent from a Raspberry Pi. 

### C++
- Difficult but efficient
- 10-100x faster than Python
    - Look at boolean byte sizes?
