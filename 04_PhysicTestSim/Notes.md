- This file will discuss modeling/simulation of Gimli

## Engineering Simulation Software

### Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE)
- Simulating real-world scenarios in a virtual environment to aid in engineering development projects

### ANSYS 
- A providor of CAE and multiphysics simulations
    - Offers: 3D Design, Electronics, Fluids, Optics and Structures

### NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- More intensive and better scalability. Load 3D build into the system and test. 
- Built for NVIDIA chips
- Uploads in URDF or MJCF formats
