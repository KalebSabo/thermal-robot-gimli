# Notes on Simulations
- This file will discuss modeling/simulation of Gimli

## Engineering Simulation Software

### Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE)
- Simulating real-world scenarios in a virtual environment to aid in engineering development projects

### ANSYS 
- Focus on **individual structural and fluid dynamics** rather than full-system sim
- Advanced finite element analysis (FEA), Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
- Extremely high cost (10k/y), limited student version free


### NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- More intensive and better scalability. 
- Photo-realistic environments
- Parallel sim with AI/Machine Vision.
- Consider for AI components
- **High scalability** to the point of needing better hardware
- Free for developers/research
- Requires license for commercial

### Gazebo
- open source, free, offline support, privacy/risk averse
- Easily supports FreeCAD uploads
